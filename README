# Army Game Project

***A game for two players, which consists of two types of units.
Set a board size, the amount of total units, and the type of each unit in your team.***

## `unit_create.py` - contains all info about unit objects;

Any given unit cannot attack by itself, and additional logic is needed. Thus `unit_create.py`
does not contain methods to attack another unit and such logic is implemented in `main.team_turn()`.  
Project currently utilizes two types of units: infantry and cavalry.
More units can be added via the `unit_create.py`.  
However, more logic is needed to be implemented in `main.py` to account for new units.

## `team_create.py` - contains all info about team object. Uses unit_create.py in itself;


## `board_create.py` - contains all info about board object. Uses team_create.py in itself;


## `main.py` - contains all the logic. 

The way the game goes is set in `team_turn()` and `main()`.  
The way to assign units to each team is set in `add_units()`.  
The project supports validation for all inputted values. 
The validation is described in the next three functions:  
* `is_valid_type()`
* `ret_of_type()`
* `ret_valid()`
